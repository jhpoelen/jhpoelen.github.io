---------------------------------------------------
-> # Open Questions <-

-> What are benefits of *openly sharing* (interaction) data? <-

-> What *should* be benefits of openly sharing (interaction) data? <-

-> How do *you* benefit from openly sharing (interaction) data? <-


---------------------------------------------------

-> [Why Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI)?](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/about) <-

-> GloBI provides *open access* <-
<br>

-> to finding species interaction data <-
-> (e.g., predator-prey, pollinator-plant, pathogen-host, parasite-host) <-
<br>

-> by combining existing *open datasets* <-
-> using *open source* software. <-

---------------------------------------------------

-> What makes GloBI tick? <-

-> I think that GloBI (currently) exists because ... <-
<br>

-> *you* are willing to share <-
<br>
-> your skills, knowledge, and resources <-
<br>
-> for *mutual* benefit. <- 

---------------------------------------------------

-> What does GloBI offer? <-

-> Primarily, <-
<br>
-> in my mind, <-
<br>

-> A network of folks <-
-> willing to share <-
-> their skills, resources and knowledge <-
-> for mutual benefit. <-

\- [GloBI Indexing Process](https://globalbioticinteractions.org/process)

\ - uses open source software like: 
\   - [Nomer](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/nomer), 
\   - [Elton](https://github.com/globalbioticinteractions/elton),
\   - and thousands of other open software libraries

\ - uses open-ish platforms like:
